To Create my Project, I used jGRASP as the IDE with Python as the language

For the GUI, I used the module PyQt5, which can be installed by running "pip install PyQt5" in the command prompt.

In addition, I used the module FPDF for downloading PDF files. This can be installed by running "pip install FPDF" in the command prompt.

For information on the prject, I used geeksforgeeks.org and stackoverflow.com for assistance with the modules that I was unfamiliar with. I also used fbla-pbl.org for information to use in the question database.
